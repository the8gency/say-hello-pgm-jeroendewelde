# About me
Hi!  
My name is Jeroen Dewelde, at the moment I'm a student Front-end-Developer at the *Arteveldehogeschool* in Ghent. 

I love to transform designs into code and break my head on some challenging code.

Besides coding I'm an enthousiastic person, who loves going out with friends or listening to some good music while making comfort food.
